Users are presented with a monthly view on the left side of the page and a daily view on the right side of the page. Once saved, events will appear on the right side and there will be clear indication regarding eventful dates on the monthly view. With the use of local storage, events will persist even after refreshing the page. 

### Features 

Users are notified and not able to enter invalid time formats. Navigation features include next and previous buttons at the top of the monthly view, ensuring seamless transitions between months. Additionally, a convenient mm/yyyy input option at the end of the monthly view facilitates effortless year-to-year changes. The 'Today' button offers a quick return to the current date, enhancing the overall user-friendly experience.
